**Summary**

- Artificial intelligence has no moral compas. So it can use all posibilities to achieve thier goals. We should solve this problem before wide using artificial intelligence.
- The 1997 match was actually the second one between Kasparov and Deep Blue, a super computer designed by IBM and it was specialized in chess-playing
- In 2015 AlphaGo (Google DeepMind invention) has beaten 9-dan professional in GO game. Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. Compared to chess, Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games, and, on average, many more alternatives to consider per move. The lower bound on the number of legal moves in Go has been estimated to be 2 x 10 ^ 170
- Artificial intelligence can help humans in everyday tasks. For example there is neural network (can learn from thier mistakes - negative feedback) that can build applications (sites) depends on image (without business logic).
- If implemented correctly it will be pretty safe (for example, if humans invent red button to turn it off)
- Autopilot cars. I think it will be safer and faster to move in such cars because most of accidents occur due to human fault. Also computer surpassing human in computer power. So it can process more posible options to avoid a collision. But yes, sometimes it can make wrong choice (for example hit pedestrian to safe a driver)

### The news

**Missile threat alert for Hawaii false alarm**

- credibility (доверие)

The alert of an incoming ballistic missile was sent wrongly on Saturday (13 January 2018) morning by an emergency system worker. The alert system is in place because of the potential proximity of Hawaii to North Korean missiles.
 

The computer system that allows the Hawaiian Emergency Management Agency (HEMA) to send emergency alerts asks employees to select the type of alert that they are sending from a drop-down menu.

Among the options available are two for missile alerts, according to the Washington Post. One is labelled “test missile alert”, which will test the notification system is working without actually sending an alert to the public. The other is labelled “missile alert”. Selecting that option will send an alert to every mobile phone in Hawaii. That was the option the HEMA employee mistakenly selected.

Mobile phone users received the message at 08:07 (18:07 GMT): "Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill."

This message sparking panic amongst some residents. People was trying to find safe places. SOme of them sheltered in their houses. Drivers stoped their cars in tunnels. A lot of activities was canceled. I have read about 20 football matches was canceled. People prepared for real ballistic strike.

Second emergency alert confirming the false alarm was sent to phones in Hawaii only 38 minutes after the initial message.

A false alarm warning Hawaiians of an incoming ballistic missile on Saturday, was reportedly issued because of a “terribly designed” user interface. So this story describes how important to have user-friendly interface in military applications.


Another concern after the false alarm is how people could react to the next emergency alert.

- drum roll - барабанная дробь
- unwritten - внегласный
- convenient - удобный, комфортный
- questionable - сомнительный, ненадежный
- exceed - превышать, превосходить


Hi everyone. First of all, let me thank you all for coming here today. But the truth is that you haven't other option.

For those of you who don't know me (I hope there is not such persons here), my name is Roma. Besides working as frontend developer I'm also (drum roll ....) unwritten head of service Yandex Taxi. Today I'd like to give you overview of this service and tell about benefits of using it.

I've divided my presentation into two main parts. So, let me first give you a brief review.

In a huge metropolis life never stops even for a minute. People constantly go somewhere: to work, airport, railway station, concerts, and so on. And often moving in public transport is not very convenient (especially if you have  large bags or suitcase). So you decide to order taxi. But in the past process of ordering a taxi, especially at airports and railway stations was reduced to communicating with questionable persons. Constantly hear the phrases such as "Sit down, dear" or "Can you show the way?". To the question about how much it will cost you always heard the phrase "Don't worry, will reach an agreement."

And here comes our product: Yandex Taxi. It allows to minimize the time of searching the car, because now it is the computer's task. All you need to do is open the application, select desired tariff (economy, business and premium) and destination point and place you order pressing the button "Order taxi". The computer receives your order, searches the nearest car to you depending on your location and sends notification to the driver. The driver receives the order with the point of passenger's location. On personal experience the waiting time does not exceed 5-6 minutes. Moreover payment can be done by cash or card. 

In additional to this and considering our theme, I'd like to say that this service helps introverts to order taxi, because it minimizes communication with the driver (for the whole trip you can say no word).

Finally, I think that's everything I wanted to say about Yandex Taxi. In conclusion I'd like to recommend to install our application if you haven't done it during my presentation and tell about special offer. If you install now Yandex Taxi you will get special luxury tariff that helps you to  make one trip on special car without traffic jam. Here's the photo of our special car: 

---photo---

That's all. Thanks for attetion. I'm glad to answer questions.

### Piece of news

- dedicate - посвящать, уделять

- attempt - попытка, стремление, пытаться
- urgent - срочный, экстренный
- beneficial - выгодный, полезный, положительный
- skim - бегло просомтреть

#### Facebook created an AI tool that can prevent suicide

For many people who've dedicated their lives to preventing suicide, social media posts can be a precious dataset that contains hints about what people say and do before they attempt suicide. In the past few years, researchers have built algorithms to learn which words and emoji are associated with suicidal thoughts. 

The technology, announced few months ago by Facebook, represents an unparalleled opportunity to understand and predict suicide risk. The tool's life-saving potential is huge. 

**How it works**

Facebook trained the AI (artificial intelligence) by finding patterns in the words and imagery used in posts that have been manually reported for suicide risk in the past. It also looks for comments like “Are you OK?” and “Do you need help?”

Now, if someone is expressing thoughts of suicide in any type of Facebook post, Facebook’s AI will detect it and flag it to prevention-trained human moderators.

When a report comes in, Facebook’s tech can highlight the part of the post or video that matches suicide-risk patterns or that’s receiving concerned comments. That avoids moderators having to skim through a whole video themselves. AI prioritizes users reports as more urgent than other types of content-policy violations

Facebook’s tools then bring up local language resources from its partners, including telephone hotlines for suicide prevention and nearby authorities. The moderator can then contact the responders and try to send them to the at-risk user’s location, surface the mental health resources to the at-risk user themselves or send them to friends who can talk to the user.

But this idea of Facebook proactively scanning the content of people’s posts could trigger some fears about how else the technology could be applied. There are certainly massive beneficial aspects about the technology, but it’s another space where we have little choice but to hope Facebook doesn’t go too far.

- cautious - осторожный
- for instance - например

**ex. 2a**

- patient and polite to others on the road like pedestrians and cyclists
- stay calm in stressful situations
- road rage incidents fewer
- cautious
- take fewer risks when overtaking
- more responsible, less likely to not to derive when tires or after drinking

12. react slowly
13. lack confidence
14. easily distructed
15. for example by children in the car
16. map reading more difficult
17. have problems
18. with left and right
19. poor spatial awareness
20. more chaper accidents

**Summary**

- spatial awareness - плохая пространственная осведомленность

This is very strange article. It contradicts itself. How women can be more safer drivers if they poor spatial awareness? They are less agressive - yes, I agree with this fact. But this article compares the stereotypes of men and women. Each person is very complex personality. I guess men can calmly estimate the circumstances instead of women (but as said not always). Some of men can be even more emotional than women. 

### Presentation about the country I want to visit

- peninsula - полуостров
- intricate - замысловатый
- squeaking breaks - скрипящих тормозов
- influential - влиятельный
- attraction - достопримечательность

Italy is a country rich in art, architecture, sights and food. The Italians are especially known for they're famous food. (Can anybody call their popular dishes?) The relative location is in Southern Europe on the Mediterranean Sea. It's shaped as a penninsula very much like a boot (I guess everybody can find it on geographic maps). It boarders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia. It's climate is about 30 degrees in the summer and about 12 degrees in the winter. Italy's population is about 60.6 millions (only five times more than in Moscow!).

The Apennines Mountains are in the center of Italy, while the Alps are on Italy's northern and northwestern border.  It's very popular destination for winter holidays (especcially for mountain skiing and snowboarding).

There are a lot of sights in this contry.  Let's overview some of them. Venice (Venezia) is one of the most unusual and romantic places in the world today. There you hear no car horns, alarms, or even squeaking brakes. It's located in northeast Italy and famous for its intricate transport system of interconnected canals. For moving is used gondolas. The most popular canal in Venice is Grand Canal. This canal is lined with beautiful buildings and churches some of which date back as far as the 13th century.  You’ll also see the Rialto Bridge that was the only bridge to cross the canal until the 19th century and was mentioned in Shakespeare’s “The Merchant of Venice”

The other town I want to mention surely is the capital of Italy: Rome(Interesting fact: name Roma comes from name Rome). The population of Rome is well over two-million. The Roman Empire has been one of the most influential civilizations of all time. Its culture has been integrated throughout many societies. This city is full of attractions preserved to our days: Colosseum, Pantheon. Moreover Rome contains the WHOLE state in itself: Vatican is a country of religion. About .44 square kilometers in total, the city-state is the central hub for the governing body of the Catholic faith

I can still talk for a very long time about Italy, about the Roman Empire, about the pros and cons of the military state, but it's time to finish my fascinating story. In conclusion I want to say that this summer I'm planning to visit this country

### Presentation. Slang words

- Dude (noun). A word that americans use to address each other. Originally, “dude” meant a stuck up person who dressed overly well. It first emerged in the year 1883 in England. Example: *Hey dude, I missed you at the movies the other day!* , *Look at that rich fellow; what a dude! Do you see the feather in his hat*
- Sick (adj). You would think this word has a negative connotation, however, ‘sick’ is similar in meaning to, “very exciting!”, “amazing!”, etc. While it can be used to describe a person, it is most often used to describe experiences or things that someone thinks is amazing. Example: *Man, that trick was sick yo*
- Nada (pronoun). Used instead of the word, “nothing”. However, it is generally used as the answer to a question rather than in the middle of a sentence. Example: *A: What's new? B: Nada...*
- Hitched (verb, adj). In slang, ‘hitched’ means two people have married. Example: *We are getting hitched.*
- Nerd out (verb). Getting overly excited about something that isn't generally "cool". Example: *I completely nerd-out when I watch Harry Potter*
- Chill (adj, verb). Another common colloquial (разговорное) word in American informal vocabulary. ‘Chill’ can describe something that is relaxed, easy, and fun. It can also be used as a verb meaning you are relaxing, and being easy going. Also it can mean to calm down. Example: *A: I hate you! Die, bitch! B: Wow, chill*, *A: Check out my new sick ride! B: Yeah, that's pretty chill*
- Bombed (verb). Means to completely fail something. It is also used as a verb to say you are getting very drunk. Example: *I bombed both midterms and I didn't study for the final*
- Fire (adj). Saying something is ‘fire’ means it is outstanding (hot). Example: *Damn this food is fire. That girl is looking fire.*
- Retweet (verb).  Originating from the online news and networking service Twitter, the linguistic expression, “Retweet”, in conversation means the person agrees with you. Example: *A: Dude, I'm so tired bro. B: Retweet my friend. Retweet. Got three hours of sleep because I was studying*
- Swing (verb). The term ‘swing’ has multiple informal meanings in the English language. One meaning is used when telling someone you will come by their house or workplace for a short period of time by saying, *I’ll swing by*. Another informal meaning of the word ‘swing’ is to explain your sexual orientation. If someone asks if you are a homosexual, you may respond by saying, *I don’t swing that way*.
- Drop (verb). A word used when enlightening someone with information. Often heard in the expression, “let me drop some knowledge on you”. Also used in reference to releasing music in the expression, *I’m gonna drop this mixtape*.
- Bestie (noun) (british slang). Meaning best friends. Example: *She’s my bestie*.
- Gotcha (exclamation). You would you this word on it’s own to acknowledge that you understand something someone is saying. Example: *A: Please don't do that again bro. B: Gotcha*
- Yolo (phrase and expression) ‘Yolo’ is short for the phrase, “You Only Live Once”. This phrase is popular with teenagers and young adults. It’s meaning is implying that you should live your life how you want because you only get one of them. The phrase is shortened to ‘yolo’ in verbal conversation.

### Presentation. British and American cuisine. How do you think eating habits reflect American and British values and priorities?

The cousine in Britain and America are different. For example britains at breakfast like to eat toasts or eggs with cup of tee. Americans more like bacon at breakfast. Also americans like more fatty food considering the amount of fast food points.

I decide to overview typical going to restraunt.

**The occasion**

In Britain, going out for a meal is almost always done to mark an occasion: a birthday, a reunion, an anniversary. But in America, it can be done just because you haven’t yet tried Chili’s new Awesome Avocado Bacon Milkshake Sugar Burger! Mmm.

**Water**

The first thing that happens when you sit down in an American restaurant is that you’re asked if you’d like bottled or tap water. If you choose bottled, you’ll then be asked whether you’d prefer still or sparkling. A moment later your water of choice appears on the table. In Britain, water must be apologetically requested from your server.

**Substitutions**

In the U.S., it’s perfectly acceptable to customize your order. “I’ll have the Waldorf salad, but hold the pecans, and instead of apple I’ll have cucumber.” In the U.K., you get what you’re given and if you don’t like it then you can jolly well go and eat somewhere else.

**Food preparation**

If you order a burger in the U.K. (not recommended) the chances of being asked how you would like it cooked are about as likely as bumping into the queen in the frozen food section of your local supermarket. They serve it one way and one way only: very well done. And what about the eggs? The choice of how you want your eggs cooked in the U.S. is so vast that an entire Mind The Gap piece has been dedicated to it. Generally speaking, the American attitude is veered towards accommodating the customer; whereas in the U.K., the feeling is that you’re lucky they’ve got eggs at all

**Service**

There is a huge difference in the attitude towards waiters. In the U.S, waiting tables is a good service job that people are proud to do well. Thus they are treated by customers as professionals. In Britain, waiters tend to be treated more like servants, and the customer finds the relationship slightly embarrassing.

**Tipping**

This is probably the biggest and most obvious difference. The British are not used to leaving a tip. They feel cheated by it. But they don’t realize is that a lot of American wait staff don’t get paid an hourly wage. So their income depends on tips. Problems arise in the U.S. if the service happens to be below par; Brits feel like they shouldn’t leave any gratuity for poor service, but really they’re just being cheap so they can spend their dollars on cheap Levi’s.


British society is based on the idea that everybody follows the same rules. No one is above the law. America are more customer-oriented. Americans take pride in making the best use of their time

### Piece of news

- assumption - предположение, допущение

Today I will try the role of a bartender and make a great mix from America news.

At first I wanna talk about car in the space. I think everybody heard that SpaceX company helmed by billionaire Elon Musk has launched the world's most powerful rocket - Falcon Heavy. And as a payload it used a new prototype of Tesla car - Roadster. The rocket's smooth takeoff wasn't the only stunning thing about this launch. In a never-before-seen feat, SpaceX also managed to guide at least two of the Falcon Heavy's first-stage rocket boosters to land upright back on Earth. They cut back through the Earth's atmosphere and landed in unison at a Kennedy Space Center landing pad. According to Elon Musk that was probably the most exciting thing he has ever seen. The third booster was supposed to land on a sea-faring platform called a droneship -- but after launch it crashed.

This news was actively discussed in social networks. And someone made a pretty interesting assumption: that in that car was the worst enemy of Elon Musk. So it can become the crime of the century. 

Also few days ago SpaceX lauched demo satellites for its high-speed internet project. The satellites will test out the technology the company plans to use for its internet service. SpaceX eventually wants to put more than 10,000 tiny satellites into Low-Earth Orbit to deliver internet to people at speeds similar to the quickest ground-based internet connections.

Now we come to the last ingredient (topic) that will be used in our mix. And it is more discussable (so you may help me here). It will be dedicated to the guns. For the last few months there were several cruel school shootings. The last one was in Parkland, Florida where the aggressive and unstable schoolboy has killed 17 people. According to the stats about 40% of Americans say they own a gun or live in a household with one. And in 2016 US was on the first place on gun-related killing as a % of all homicides. The first Trump's reaction was arming school teachers as a protective and preventive measure against school shootings. But I don't think it's a good idea to protect children by increasing number of arming persons in school. For example, how can we be sure that the teacher wouldn't be a psychopath. Another idea was to raise the legal age to buy a rifle to 21. It is more productive idea, but as I know this idea not have enough support to pass the Senate. My opinion in this question is to cancel the legal carrying of weapons. And allow it (weapon) for special trained persons: policemen or bodyguards.

What do you think? Do you have any ideas for this question?

### Words

- interjection - междометие
- scold - ругать, бранить, ворчать
- colloquial - разговорный
- notion - понятие, представление, мнение
- quaking - дрожащий, трясущийся
- lampoon - пасквиль
- libel - клевета, поклеп
- wacko - сумасшедший
- striking - поразительный, выдающийся
- Mayor [mɛə] - мэр

- **Правда** и **Истина**. On one hand they are synonyms — they are both “truth” but on the other hand they are and not synonyms — they mean different kinds of truth. There are a very interesting distinction between these words. **Правда** is subjective and **Истина** is objective. **Правда** is the knowledge of a specific, actual episode of reality. This knowledge may be incomplete, since only a fragment is opened in front of a person in this case, and not the whole. **Истина** is knowledge connected with the spiritual, intellectual sphere. It is close to the universal, divine laws of existence. It can't be questioned because it is absolute. *Interesting fact*: up to the XIX century these words had the opposite character. Before the truth  used to be presented as a human being, and the truth as a divine beginning <Image>
- **Извинить** и **Простить**. For minor infractions like prank, mistake, being late you can use either both words. *Извини за опоздание*. *Прости, ошиблась.* The word **простить** used when you forgive with all your heart and soul. It’s the word you can use in church. But **извинить** is used for the smaller gaffes and errors. *Извини, что я тебя перебил.* But language is constantly changing. Today **извините** has also turned into something like an interjection. When you make a phone call, for example, you might say, *Извините, можно Пашу к телефону?*. Another linguist has noted that **извините** has become a general form of address, what you say to get the attention of a stranger on the street: *Извините, не подскажете, где улица Тверская?*. And then there is the verb **Извиняюсь** which has divided the Russian-speaking world into two irreconcilable camps. One camp defines the word as a reflexive form of **извинять** — to forgive oneself. So, if you accept this, when people are scolded (saying bad words) and they reply, *Извиняюсь* they aren’t asking for forgiveness or saying they’re sorry, they are just saying, *I was wrong and now I forgive myself.* Folks on the other side of the argument say that it is now just a way of saying **простите/извините**. They consider it colloquial, but widespread and acceptable.
- **Кайф**. What does “thrill” mean?  You can said, “Oh, no problem! A thrill is, you know, ’Wow!’. It’s when you are happy and excited. But it can also be something scary but kind of fun. **Thrill** can be defined as a mixture of excitement and pleasure; fun fear - a feeling of excitement about something that will be pleasant and yet a bit frightening without being truly dangerous — like a ride on a roller coaster. There is one word in Russian that more or less combines the notions of intense emotion, fun, excitement and possible danger (Try to guess?): **кайф**. But it’s the slangy and originally mean narcotic high.
- **Трепетать**. It is close to the experience of a thrill, but much less extreme. *Он трепетал от радости* (He shook with joy). *Она трепетала от ужаса* (She was horrified). If you use the expression **трепетать перед** (to be quaking before), it means to experience fear mixed with respect: *Он трепетал перед начальством* (He was terribly intimidated by management).
- **Ощущения**. Another noun you can use is **ощущение** (feeling) which can be modified with adjectives like острое (extreme); сильное (strong); or захватывающее (breath-taking). Here, too, it’s sometimes tough to tell if the emotions are positive or negative: *Роман вызвал у меня сильные ощущения* (The novel really affected me, literally "evoked strong feelings in me“). **Острые ощущения** are usually fun-scary. In fact, **любитель острых ощущений** is a thrill-seeker. If you want to convey a sense of breathtaking excitement, you can use **захватывающий**
- **Пасквиль**. The word comes from the Italian character Pasquino — one of Rome’s "talking statues." Since the 16th century, people have posted anonymous letters on the statues, making them something like the first Facebook pages, only anonymous. In Russian, the word came to mean a lampoon or, in legal terminology, libel. **Пасквиль** is always a very bad thing. *Некоторые книги  изымали на советской таможне, а газеты в Москве называли их злобным пасквилем*.
- **Сатира** (satire). It is defined as "проявление комического в искусстве, состоящее в уничтожающем осмеянии явлений, которые представляются автору порочными“ (the use of the comic in art, which consists of destructive ridicule of phenomena that the author considers to be evil). 
- **Клевета** (slander) — nasty lies meant to harm someone’s reputation. *С одной стороны, мы видели восхваление врага и вражеской литературы, с другой стороны ― клевету на советское партийное искусство (On the one hand we saw praise of the enemy and enemy literature, and on the other hand — slander of Soviet Party-approved art.)* 
- **Инсинуация** (злостный вымысел, внушение негативных мыслей, тайное подстрекательство). If you don’t like native Russian words, you can try imports, like **инсинуация** (insinuation). *Мы не желаем даже комментировать подобные инсинуации* (We don’t even wish to comment on such insinuation/innuendo).
- **Диффамация** (распространение не соответствующих действительности порочащих сведений). Another imported word is диффамация (defamation). Стихотворные надписи содержат прямую диффамацию русских (The poetic inscriptions contain clear defamation of Russians.)
- **Стрёмно** (scary, weird, unpleasant). **Стрёмно** is a funny word. You won’t find it in any Soviet academic dictionaries. In more recently published general dictionaries it is noted as vulgar.  I’m not quite sure, but the writer (Michele Berdy) has discovered that its origins are in prison slang. **Стрём** is both a look-out and the danger the look-out is looking out for. **Стрёмно** covers a range of meanings: dangerous, frightening, weird or unpleasant. *Мне стремно* (Мне страшно). You can say *стоять* (literally to stand) or *быть на стрёме* (to be on guard). This can be external guard duty: *Вася, стоящий на стрёме*. Or it can be an internal guard: У меня чуткий сон, как у собаки. Да тут любой на стрёме будет. (I’m a light sleeper, like a dog. But anyone would be on edge here). You might hear **стрёмно** and related words used more to mean weird, wacko (сумашедший), or striking (поразительный). *Там стрёмная обстановка* (The situation there is hinky). The adjective стрёмный can refer to a person who is dangerous, fearless, and powerful: *Видишь этого стрёмного мужика?*

### The most weird professions

**Line-standers**

Professional line-standers do one thing most of us have no patience for: waiting in line. These professionals are especially busy during big sales (think Black Friday) and product launches (new iPhone releases, for example). Rates vary, but one professional line-stander told that he earns up to $1,000 a week.

**TV watcher**

This is a job where you get paid to watch television, just like it says in the description. However, there's a lot more work involved than just passively watching your favorite show. Pro TV watchers usually scan through different shows and news clips, and find the right clips that can be used on a television show or news program.

**Human Scarecrow (United Kingdom)**

There have been stories of students actually doing this part time.

**Professional Hitchhiker (Indonesia)**

The government has restricted some lanes of traffic to only cars with 3 or more people due to overcrowding. Poor people from the city outskirts take advantage of this by offering drivers to ride with them in the “fast lanes”.

**Professional foreigner**

Some Chinese companies will pay men $1,000 a week to wear a business suit and shake hands with Chinese businessmen. Others will hire foreigners to attend real-estate events and pose as celebrities. Foreigners are being hired to pose as celebrities by Chinese real-estate developers to help agents sell property in "ghost towns" by making them appear more animated and worldly, according to a new mini-documentary released by The New York Times.

"There are many places in China, especially in remote places, where the houses are really overvalued," a real-estate agent from the outskirts of Chongqing told The Times. "But there is this trick: make it international."

The client can pick and choose whom they want to pose at their event, down to the foreigners' nationalities and skin colors.

"Now, it is true that the price of white people is expensive," the same agent told Borenstein. "But it makes the place feel classier."

If a client can't afford a white foreigner, he or she is advised to choose black actors instead who have "a very open personality, yet are quite cheap."

"It is a widespread belief in China that if foreigners are hired at an event, the whole thing is bumped up to another level."

**Magician**

One the the most amaing and exicting job. I very like to view tricks. After some of them you want to start believing in magic. And today I want to show you imrpovisation (Have taken personal lessons from Geano Triggiano in Monday). Some of them I may not do very well, but I will try.

### Piece of news

- carbohydrates [ˈkɑːbəʊˈhaɪdreɪt] - углеводы
- appealing - привлекательный

**Finding the motivation to keep fit is a universal struggle, but what if you were paid to exercise?**

In our days there are a lot of different fitness application that helps your to keep yourself in shape. These applications count the number of performed exercises, show how to correctly perform them, help to follow the diet and count the number of calories'. But despite all this diversity, many still do not have enough motivation to start training. But what if you were paid for exercise?

That's the idea behind Sweatcoin, a free app that turns your steps into digital currency.

Russian fitness fanatics Oleg Fomenko and Anton Derlyatka came up with the idea in 2015 when Fomenko had lost the motivation to work out after his previous startup went under.

The London-based pair, both in their 40s, realized the problem with getting people to exercise is the human tendency to prioritize immediate pleasure over long-term gain.

"We started talking about how we can use modern technology to give you instant gratification for physical activity", Fomenko said.

In 2016, they founded Sweatcoin. The app pays users 0.95 sweatcoins for every 1,000 steps they take outdoors. That digital currency can be traded for fitness gear, giftcards and workout classes in the app's marketplace.

About 20,000 sweatcoins -- that's just over 21 million steps -- can be exchanged for an iPhone X.

"If you remember that your steps can be converted into something valuable, you're slightly more likely to walk rather than take a bus," Derlyatka said.

Some users have complained, though, that it can take a long time to accrue enough sweatcoins to purchase the more appealing items - and that sometimes the ones they're really interested in have disappeared by the time they reach the required amount.

Available in the US and the UK, the app now has 10 million users. Its creators say that its success hinged on making sure the step-counting technology was watertight. As creators said they realized that as soon as they turn movement into currency, into value, they are automatically attracting a lot of falsification. There are thousands of people who attempt to trick them every day. To stop people cheating, Sweatcoin uses a cellphone's inbuilt step sensor to track movement. An algorithm then checks the phone's readings for speed, consistency of movement and location to eliminate any false data.

### USA selections

You might think that the person who receives the most votes wins, right?
Wrong.

This is because, contrary to popular belief, voters do not actually elect the president. Voters are merely indicating a preference for president, but the task of actually electing the president falls to 538 individual electors to the US Electoral College.

**What is the Electoral College?**

To put it simply, each state is assigned a number of electors to the Electoral College, based on that state’s delegation to the United States Congress.

There are 50 states.

Each state has two members of the US Senate, so there are 100 senators.

There are 435 members of the US House of Representatives, who are appointed by state on the basis of population, with each state having a minimum of one.

Therefore, the least populous states, such as Alaska and Wyoming, send three members to Congress - two senators and one representative. Conversely, the most populous state, California, sends two senators and 53 representatives, for a total of 55.

California’s vote in the Electoral College is therefore 55.

This means that all 50 states send a total of 535 members to Congress.

In addition, the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.), sends one non-voting member to the House of Representatives (hence the slogan, “taxation without representation”), but no senators. However, when it comes to the Electoral College, D.C. is afforded the same number of votes as the smallest state - three.

The total votes in the Electoral College is therefore 538.

To win the presidency, a candidate needs an absolute majority vote in the Electoral College, which is half plus one, or 270. This is why you will hear a lot about the magic number “270” on Election Day.

If no one wins an absolute majority of the Electoral College, then the election is decided by a vote in the US House of Representatives, which has occurred on just one occasion (1824).

Electoral College “electors” are not usually members of Congress. Depending on the state, “electors” are elected by voters or state legislatures, or they are appointed.

**Election day voting**

Forty-eight states, plus the District of Columbia, have a winner-takes-all approach to their Electoral College votes. This means that on election day, if Hillary Clinton wins the popular vote in California by a single vote, she wins all of California’s 55 Electoral College votes.

It therefore does not matter by how many votes Clinton or Trump win in each state, as long as they win more than the next person. A majority vote is not required, as the winner of the popular vote for each state by a plurality will win all of the electoral college votes.

There are two exceptions: Maine and Nebraska.

These two states award some of their electoral college votes on the basis of congressional district.

For example, Maine has two members of the House of Representatives, plus two senators, therefore it has four electoral college votes. One vote is awarded to whichever presidential candidate wins the most votes in each of the two congressional districts. The state’s two “senatorial” votes are then awarded to whoever wins the most votes overall in the state. This is why in 2008, Barack Obama won a single vote from Nebraska, because he won one of Nebraska’s three districts, while John McCain won the other two, and the state.

Confused? If you have made it this far, then you are almost an expert! Well done.

Long before election day, we know how most of the states will vote. For example, we know that Alabama will vote for Trump, and we know that Rhode Island will vote for Clinton. In fact, we already know what the result will be in approximately 40 states.

So candidates focus their campaigns on the remaining 10 states in which the outcome is less certain. These states comprise the so-called “swing” states, such as Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Virginia, and Colorado, plus a few others, like North Carolina, Missouri, and Indiana.

In the final two weeks before election day, it is these swing states that will receive all the attention from candidates.

So a presidential candidate is not aiming to win the popular vote across the country. They are not aiming to win all 50 states (although several have come close, such as Richard Nixon in 1972, and Ronald Reagan in 1984, each of whom won 49 states). A presidential candidate is aiming to win a majority of the Electoral College, in whatever shape that takes.

# Lesson 20

- desire - желание, стремление

### The importance of studying a foreign language, some features of monolingualism, bilingualism and multilingualism, your favorite language (why is it so?), the strangest language you have ever heard, the language you want  to study in the future.

I guess the most important need in studying a foreign language is desire to travel. You need to know language on wich speak in country you plan to visit. Because without that you can't learn history of the country and sights. Also you can't correctly communicate with local residents.

Particularly in some primarily monolingual countries — for instance, Japan or China — or native English - speaking countries, such as the United States, bilingualism or even multilingualism is not a rare or exceptional phenomenon in the modern world

Body language is a type of non-verbal communication in which physical behavior, as opposed to words, are used to express information. Such behavior includes facial expressions, body posture, gestures, eye movement, touch and the use of space. It is also known as kinesics.

Body language must not be confused with sign language, as sign languages are full languages like spoken languages and have their own complex grammar systems, as well as being able to exhibit the fundamental properties that exist in all languages. Body language, on the other hand, does not have a grammar and must be interpreted broadly, instead of having an absolute meaning corresponding with a certain movement, so it is not a language like sign language, and is simply termed as a "language" due to popular culture.

My borther had been starting learn japanese. So, I can say it's very strange language. Espicailly all languages, where you need to learn about 50000 hieroglyphs are strange. For example the biggest chinese dictionary of hieroglyphs includes 85568 hieroglyphs. Also the process of drawing a hieroglyph is slower than letters.

### Britain and America are two nations divided by a common language.

Often it’s not just pronunciation that differs between how people from different geographical areas, countries or social classes pronounce the English language. Sometimes the actual words used are different too.

I'm reading historical novel "London" (very recommend to read). And today have read interesting facts especially for our lesson. (One of the main characters of the novel is working in sewing business).

In the UK "Pants" typically refers to underwear. It is also a slang term for "bad". As in *That's pants*. In other parts of the world, notably the USA, "pants" refers to trousers.

The same story with word "vest" and "waistcoat" (жилетка). Brits use "waistcoast" when Americans use more simple word: "vest".

Moreover there is an interesting word difference that I have found in Internet. There is a word "white coffee" used in Britain. Can you guess how this drink call in USA (because of the obvious problem). The correct answer: "coffee with cream".
