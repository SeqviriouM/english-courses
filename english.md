**Summary**

- Artificial intelligence has no moral compas. So it can use all posibilities to achieve thier goals. We should solve this problem before wide using artificial intelligence.
- The 1997 match was actually the second one between Kasparov and Deep Blue, a super computer designed by IBM and it was specialized in chess-playing
- In 2015 AlphaGo (Google DeepMind invention) has beaten 9-dan professional in GO game. Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. Compared to chess, Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games, and, on average, many more alternatives to consider per move. The lower bound on the number of legal moves in Go has been estimated to be 2 x 10 ^ 170
- Artificial intelligence can help humans in everyday tasks. For example there is neural network (can learn from thier mistakes - negative feedback) that can build applications (sites) depends on image (without business logic).
- If implemented correctly it will be pretty safe (for example, if humans invent red button to turn it off)
- Autopilot cars. I think it will be safer and faster to move in such cars because most of accidents occur due to human fault. Also computer surpassing human in computer power. So it can process more posible options to avoid a collision. But yes, sometimes it can make wrong choice (for example hit pedestrian to safe a driver)

### The news

**Missile threat alert for Hawaii false alarm**

- credibility (доверие)

The alert of an incoming ballistic missile was sent wrongly on Saturday (13 January 2018) morning by an emergency system worker. The alert system is in place because of the potential proximity of Hawaii to North Korean missiles.
 

The computer system that allows the Hawaiian Emergency Management Agency (HEMA) to send emergency alerts asks employees to select the type of alert that they are sending from a drop-down menu.

Among the options available are two for missile alerts, according to the Washington Post. One is labelled “test missile alert”, which will test the notification system is working without actually sending an alert to the public. The other is labelled “missile alert”. Selecting that option will send an alert to every mobile phone in Hawaii. That was the option the HEMA employee mistakenly selected.

Mobile phone users received the message at 08:07 (18:07 GMT): "Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill."

This message sparking panic amongst some residents. People was trying to find safe places. SOme of them sheltered in their houses. Drivers stoped their cars in tunnels. A lot of activities was canceled. I have read about 20 football matches was canceled. People prepared for real ballistic strike.

Second emergency alert confirming the false alarm was sent to phones in Hawaii only 38 minutes after the initial message.

A false alarm warning Hawaiians of an incoming ballistic missile on Saturday, was reportedly issued because of a “terribly designed” user interface. So this story describes how important to have user-friendly interface in military applications.


Another concern after the false alarm is how people could react to the next emergency alert.

 It obviously belongs to someone who walks into a room and likes everyone to know he's there. The way he uses the box tells me that he is quite sociable and outgoing. The signature looks fairly normal but the letters lean that way. If you combine that with the narrow gap between the words, then you have someone who is ambitious and self-confident. Finally, the way he finishes of the signature with the lines makes this person real extrovert

Hi everyone. First of all, let me thank you all for coming here today. But the truth is that you haven't other option.

For those of you who don't know me (I hope there is not such persons here), my name is Roma. Besides working as frontend developer I'm also (drum roll ....) unwritten head of service Yandex Taxi. Today I'd like to give you overview of this service and tell about benefits of using it.

I've divided my presentation into two main parts. So, let me first give you a brief review.

In a huge metropolis life never stops even for a minute. People constantly go somewhere: to work, airport, railway station, concerts, and so on. And often moving in public transport is not very convenient (especially if you have  large bags or suitcase). So you decide to order taxi. But in the past process of ordering a taxi, especially at airports and railway stations was reduced to communicating with questionable persons. Constantly hear the phrases such as "Sit down, dear" or "Can you show the way?". To the question about how much it will cost you always heard the phrase "Don't worry, will reach an agreement."

And here comes our product: Yandex Taxi (???). It allows to minimize the time of searching the car, because now it is the computer's task. All you need to do is open the application, select desired tariff (economy, business and premium) and destination point and place you order pressing the button "Order taxi". The computer receives your order, searches the nearest car to you depending on your location and sends notification to the driver. The driver receives the order with the point of passenger's location. On personal experience the waiting time does not exceed 5-6 minutes. Moreover payment can be done by cash or card. 

In additional to this and considering our theme, I'd like to say that this service helps introverts to order taxi, because it minimizes communication with the driver (for the whole trip you can say no word).

Finally, I think that's everything I wanted to say about Yandex Taxi. In conclusion I'd like to recommend to install our application if you haven't done it during my presentation and tell about special offer. If you install now Yandex Taxi you will get special luxury tariff that helps you to  make one trip on special car without traffic jam. Here's the photo of our special car: ---photo---

That's all. Thanks for attetion. I'm glad to answer questions.
