**Summary**

- Artificial intelligence has no moral compas. So it can use all posibilities to achieve thier goals. We should solve this problem before wide using artificial intelligence.
- The 1997 match was actually the second one between Kasparov and Deep Blue, a super computer designed by IBM and it was specialized in chess-playing
- In 2015 AlphaGo (Google DeepMind invention) has beaten 9-dan professional in GO game. Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. Compared to chess, Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games, and, on average, many more alternatives to consider per move. The lower bound on the number of legal moves in Go has been estimated to be 2 x 10 ^ 170
- Artificial intelligence can help humans in everyday tasks. For example there is neural network (can learn from thier mistakes - negative feedback) that can build applications (sites) depends on image (without business logic).
- If implemented correctly it will be pretty safe (for example, if humans invent red button to turn it off)
- Autopilot cars. I think it will be safer and faster to move in such cars because most of accidents occur due to human fault. Also computer surpassing human in computer power. So it can process more posible options to avoid a collision. But yes, sometimes it can make wrong choice (for example hit pedestrian to safe a driver)

### The news

**Missile threat alert for Hawaii false alarm**

- credibility (доверие)

The alert of an incoming ballistic missile was sent wrongly on Saturday (13 January 2018) morning by an emergency system worker. The alert system is in place because of the potential proximity of Hawaii to North Korean missiles.
 

The computer system that allows the Hawaiian Emergency Management Agency (HEMA) to send emergency alerts asks employees to select the type of alert that they are sending from a drop-down menu.

Among the options available are two for missile alerts, according to the Washington Post. One is labelled “test missile alert”, which will test the notification system is working without actually sending an alert to the public. The other is labelled “missile alert”. Selecting that option will send an alert to every mobile phone in Hawaii. That was the option the HEMA employee mistakenly selected.

Mobile phone users received the message at 08:07 (18:07 GMT): "Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill."

This message sparking panic amongst some residents. People was trying to find safe places. SOme of them sheltered in their houses. Drivers stoped their cars in tunnels. A lot of activities was canceled. I have read about 20 football matches was canceled. People prepared for real ballistic strike.

Second emergency alert confirming the false alarm was sent to phones in Hawaii only 38 minutes after the initial message.

A false alarm warning Hawaiians of an incoming ballistic missile on Saturday, was reportedly issued because of a “terribly designed” user interface. So this story describes how important to have user-friendly interface in military applications.


Another concern after the false alarm is how people could react to the next emergency alert.

- drum roll - барабанная дробь
- unwritten - внегласный
- convenient - удобный, комфортный
- questionable - сомнительный, ненадежный
- exceed - превышать, превосходить


Hi everyone. First of all, let me thank you all for coming here today. But the truth is that you haven't other option.

For those of you who don't know me (I hope there is not such persons here), my name is Roma. Besides working as frontend developer I'm also (drum roll ....) unwritten head of service Yandex Taxi. Today I'd like to give you overview of this service and tell about benefits of using it.

I've divided my presentation into two main parts. So, let me first give you a brief review.

In a huge metropolis life never stops even for a minute. People constantly go somewhere: to work, airport, railway station, concerts, and so on. And often moving in public transport is not very convenient (especially if you have  large bags or suitcase). So you decide to order taxi. But in the past process of ordering a taxi, especially at airports and railway stations was reduced to communicating with questionable persons. Constantly hear the phrases such as "Sit down, dear" or "Can you show the way?". To the question about how much it will cost you always heard the phrase "Don't worry, will reach an agreement."

And here comes our product: Yandex Taxi. It allows to minimize the time of searching the car, because now it is the computer's task. All you need to do is open the application, select desired tariff (economy, business and premium) and destination point and place you order pressing the button "Order taxi". The computer receives your order, searches the nearest car to you depending on your location and sends notification to the driver. The driver receives the order with the point of passenger's location. On personal experience the waiting time does not exceed 5-6 minutes. Moreover payment can be done by cash or card. 

In additional to this and considering our theme, I'd like to say that this service helps introverts to order taxi, because it minimizes communication with the driver (for the whole trip you can say no word).

Finally, I think that's everything I wanted to say about Yandex Taxi. In conclusion I'd like to recommend to install our application if you haven't done it during my presentation and tell about special offer. If you install now Yandex Taxi you will get special luxury tariff that helps you to  make one trip on special car without traffic jam. Here's the photo of our special car: 

---photo---

That's all. Thanks for attetion. I'm glad to answer questions.

### Piece of news

- dedicate - посвящать, уделять

- attempt - попытка, стремление, пытаться
- urgent - срочный, экстренный
- beneficial - выгодный, полезный, положительный
- skim - бегло просомтреть

#### Facebook created an AI tool that can prevent suicide

For many people who've dedicated their lives to preventing suicide, social media posts can be a precious dataset that contains hints about what people say and do before they attempt suicide. In the past few years, researchers have built algorithms to learn which words and emoji are associated with suicidal thoughts. 

The technology, announced few months ago by Facebook, represents an unparalleled opportunity to understand and predict suicide risk. The tool's life-saving potential is huge. 

**How it works**

Facebook trained the AI (artificial intelligence) by finding patterns in the words and imagery used in posts that have been manually reported for suicide risk in the past. It also looks for comments like “Are you OK?” and “Do you need help?”

Now, if someone is expressing thoughts of suicide in any type of Facebook post, Facebook’s AI will detect it and flag it to prevention-trained human moderators.

When a report comes in, Facebook’s tech can highlight the part of the post or video that matches suicide-risk patterns or that’s receiving concerned comments. That avoids moderators having to skim through a whole video themselves. AI prioritizes users reports as more urgent than other types of content-policy violations

Facebook’s tools then bring up local language resources from its partners, including telephone hotlines for suicide prevention and nearby authorities. The moderator can then contact the responders and try to send them to the at-risk user’s location, surface the mental health resources to the at-risk user themselves or send them to friends who can talk to the user.

But this idea of Facebook proactively scanning the content of people’s posts could trigger some fears about how else the technology could be applied. There are certainly massive beneficial aspects about the technology, but it’s another space where we have little choice but to hope Facebook doesn’t go too far.

- cautious - осторожный
- for instance - например

**ex. 2a**

- patient and polite to others on the road like pedestrians and cyclists
- stay calm in stressful situations
- road rage incidents fewer
- cautious
- take fewer risks when overtaking
- more responsible, less likely to not to derive when tires or after drinking

12. react slowly
13. lack confidence
14. easily distructed
15. for example by children in the car
16. map reading more difficult
17. have problems
18. with left and right
19. poor spatial awareness
20. more chaper accidents

**Summary**

- spatial awareness - плохая пространственная осведомленность

This is very strange article. It contradicts itself. How women can be more safer drivers if they poor spatial awareness? They are less agressive - yes, I agree with this fact. But this article compares the stereotypes of men and women. Each person is very complex personality. I guess men can calmly estimate the circumstances instead of women (but as said not always). Some of men can be even more emotional than women. 

### Presentation about the country I want to visit

- peninsula - полуостров
- intricate - замысловатый
- squeaking breaks - скрипящих тормозов
- influential - влиятельный
- attraction - достопримечательность

Italy is a country rich in art, architecture, sights and food. The Italians are especially known for they're famous food. (Can anybody call their popular dishes?) The relative location is in Southern Europe on the Mediterranean Sea. It's shaped as a penninsula very much like a boot (I guess everybody can find it on geographic maps). It boarders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia. It's climate is about 30 degrees in the summer and about 12 degrees in the winter. Italy's population is about 60.6 millions (only five times more than in Moscow!).

The Apennines Mountains are in the center of Italy, while the Alps are on Italy's northern and northwestern border.  It's very popular destination for winter holidays (especcially for mountain skiing and snowboarding).

There are a lot of sights in this contry.  Let's overview some of them. Venice (Venezia) is one of the most unusual and romantic places in the world today. There you hear no car horns, alarms, or even squeaking brakes. It's located in northeast Italy and famous for its intricate transport system of interconnected canals. For moving is used gondolas. The most popular canal in Venice is Grand Canal. This canal is lined with beautiful buildings and churches some of which date back as far as the 13th century.  You’ll also see the Rialto Bridge that was the only bridge to cross the canal until the 19th century and was mentioned in Shakespeare’s “The Merchant of Venice”

The other town I want to mention surely is the capital of Italy: Rome(Interesting fact: name Roma comes from name Rome). The population of Rome is well over two-million. The Roman Empire has been one of the most influential civilizations of all time. Its culture has been integrated throughout many societies. This city is full of attractions preserved to our days: Colosseum, Pantheon. Moreover Rome contains the WHOLE state in itself: Vatican is a country of religion. About .44 square kilometers in total, the city-state is the central hub for the governing body of the Catholic faith

I can still talk for a very long time about Italy, about the Roman Empire, about the pros and cons of the military state, but it's time to finish my fascinating story. In conclusion I want to say that this summer I'm planning to visit this country

- Dude (noun). A word that americans use to address each other. Originally, “dude” meant a stuck up person who dressed overly well. It first emerged in the year 1883 in England. Example: *Hey dude, I missed you at the movies the other day!* , *Look at that rich fellow; what a dude! Do you see the feather in his hat*
- Sick (adj). You would think this word has a negative connotation, however, ‘sick’ is similar in meaning to, “very exciting!”, “amazing!”, etc. While it can be used to describe a person, it is most often used to describe experiences or things that someone thinks is amazing. Example: *Man, that trick was sick yo*
- Nada (pronoun). Used instead of the word, “nothing”. However, it is generally used as the answer to a question rather than in the middle of a sentence. Example: *A: What's new? B: Nada...*
- Hitched (verb, adj). In slang, ‘hitched’ means two people have married. Example: *We are getting hitched.*
- Nerd out (verb). Getting overly excited about something that isn't generally "cool". Example: *I completely nerd-out when I watch Harry Potter*
- Chill (adj, verb). Another common colloquial (разговорное) word in American informal vocabulary. ‘Chill’ can describe something that is relaxed, easy, and fun. It can also be used as a verb meaning you are relaxing, and being easy going. Also it can mean to calm down. Example: *A: I hate you! Die, bitch! B: Wow, chill*, *A: Check out my new sick ride! B: Yeah, that's pretty chill*
- Bombed (verb). Means to completely fail something. It is also used as a verb to say you are getting very drunk. Example: *I bombed both midterms and I didn't study for the final*
- Fire (adj). Saying something is ‘fire’ means it is outstanding (hot). Example: *Damn this food is fire. That girl is looking fire.*
- Retweet (verb).  Originating from the online news and networking service Twitter, the linguistic expression, “Retweet”, in conversation means the person agrees with you. Example: *A: Dude, I'm so tired bro. B: Retweet my friend. Retweet. Got three hours of sleep because I was studying*
- Swing (verb). The term ‘swing’ has multiple informal meanings in the English language. One meaning is used when telling someone you will come by their house or workplace for a short period of time by saying, *I’ll swing by*. Another informal meaning of the word ‘swing’ is to explain your sexual orientation. If someone asks if you are a homosexual, you may respond by saying, *I don’t swing that way*.

- Gotcha (exclamation). You would you this word on it’s own to acknowledge that you understand something someone is saying. Example: *A: Please don't do that again bro. B: Gotcha*

It’s meaning is implying that you should live your life how you want because you only get one of them. The phrase is shortened to ‘yolo’ in verbal conversation.

### Presentation. British and American cuisine. How do you think eating habits reflect American and British values and priorities?

**The occasion**

In Britain, going out for a meal is almost always done to mark an occasion: a birthday, a reunion, an anniversary. But in America, it can be done just because you haven’t yet tried Chili’s new Awesome Avocado Bacon Milkshake Sugar Burger! Mmm.

**Water**

The first thing that happens when you sit down in an American restaurant is that you’re asked if you’d like bottled or tap water. If you choose bottled, you’ll then be asked whether you’d prefer still or sparkling. A moment later your water of choice appears on the table. In Britain, water must be apologetically requested from your server.

**Substitutions**

In the U.S., it’s perfectly acceptable to customize your order. “I’ll have the Waldorf salad, but hold the pecans, and instead of apple I’ll have cucumber.” In the U.K., you get what you’re given and if you don’t like it then you can jolly well go and eat somewhere else.

**Food preparation**

If you order a burger in the U.K. (not recommended) the chances of being asked how you would like it cooked are about as likely as bumping into the queen in the frozen food section of your local supermarket. They serve it one way and one way only: very well done. And what about the eggs? The choice of how you want your eggs cooked in the U.S. is so vast that an entire Mind The Gap piece has been dedicated to it. Generally speaking, the American attitude is veered towards accommodating the customer; whereas in the U.K., the feeling is that you’re lucky they’ve got eggs at all

**Service**

There is a huge difference in the attitude towards waiters. In the U.S, waiting tables is a good service job that people are proud to do well. Thus they are treated by customers as professionals. In Britain, waiters tend to be treated more like servants, and the customer finds the relationship slightly embarrassing.

**Tipping**

This is probably the biggest and most obvious difference. The British are not used to leaving a tip. They feel cheated by it. But they don’t realize is that a lot of American wait staff don’t get paid an hourly wage. So their income depends on tips. Problems arise in the U.S. if the service happens to be below par; Brits feel like they shouldn’t leave any gratuity for poor service, but really they’re just being cheap so they can spend their dollars on cheap Levi’s.
