**Summary**

- Artificial intelligence has no moral compas. So it can use all posibilities to achieve thier goals. We should solve this problem before wide using artificial intelligence.
- The 1997 match was actually the second one between Kasparov and Deep Blue, a super computer designed by IBM and it was specialized in chess-playing
- In 2015 AlphaGo (Google DeepMind invention) has beaten 9-dan professional in GO game. Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. Compared to chess, Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games, and, on average, many more alternatives to consider per move. The lower bound on the number of legal moves in Go has been estimated to be 2 x 10 ^ 170
- Artificial intelligence can help humans in everyday tasks. For example there is neural network (can learn from thier mistakes - negative feedback) that can build applications (sites) depends on image (without business logic).
- If implemented correctly it will be pretty safe (for example, if humans invent red button to turn it off)
- Autopilot cars. I think it will be safer and faster to move in such cars because most of accidents occur due to human fault. Also computer surpassing human in computer power. So it can process more posible options to avoid a collision. But yes, sometimes it can make wrong choice (for example hit pedestrian to safe a driver)
