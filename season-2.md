# Lesson 1

## Homework

### News 1. Renting luxury cars.

Mr Hashi (25 y.o.), from Newport, hired the luxury supercar Lamborghini from Saeed Ali Rent a Car on 7 August while visiting friends in Dubai. In four hours he triggered every speed camera on the Sheikh Zayed Road by driving at up to 150mph (240km/h). His fines totalled 175,000 dirhams, or £36,000 ($46,000).

The dealership where Mr Hashi rented the Lamborghini Huracán told the city's newspaper, The National, he left his passport as a guarantee. The firm said it would not give him his documents until he paid the fines. But due to its laws the firm can't hold his documents. So after receiving all fines he can leave the country. But the company could not get the Lamborghini back from officials in Dubai until Mr Hashi paid the fine.

He added his brother had not known about Dubai's speeding laws and had been forced to borrow money from a friend to pay for his extended stay. If you don't know laws doesn't mean that you can not follow them.

The most amazing in this story, that Mr Hashi's family are planning to launch legal proceedings against the firm when he returns home. (because his brother said the firm seized his brother's passport after he had driven the car).

### News 2. New tech lets submarines 'email' planes.

At present, it is difficult for planes to pick up underwater sonar signals because they reflect off the water's surface and rarely break through.

Submarines communicate using sonar waves, which travel well underwater but struggle to break through the surface. Planes communicate using radio signals that do not travel well in water.

The researchers found an extremely high-frequency radar could detect tiny ripples in water, created by an ordinary underwater speaker.
This could let lost flight recorders and submarines communicate with planes.

The system developed at MIT uses an underwater speaker to aim sonar signals directly at the water's surface, creating tiny ripples only a few micrometres in height.

These ripples can be detected by high-frequency radar above the water and decoded back into messages.

The researchers tested the idea in a swimming pool and were able to successfully receive the underwater messages from above the surface.
However, the system can take a long time to send a large amount of data - and it does not work when there are waves taller than 16cm (6in) in the water.

### Whatever it takes

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous [vʌl tʃər əs]
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up

I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline [əˈdrenəlɪn] in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom [ˈmɑːtədəm] 
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal [ˈprɔdɪgəl] son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up

I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost

I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased

And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

# Lesson 6

## Homework

### Gestures in English

**UK gestures for two**

In the UK, two fingers up in a V shape with the back of your hand towards the other person (“the V sign”) is almost as bad as the middle finger. You therefore have to be very careful how you gesture when you ask for “two items" in the UK. The most common way to show the number two is simply to turn your hand around so that your palm is facing the other person (“the peace sign”). You can also stop yourself from giving the V sign by bringing your two fingers together (without needing to turn your hand around). There is nothing offensive about using other fingers, say a thumb and index finger or the index fingers of both hands, but these are not common and it might take the other person a while to work out that you mean “two”.

**Tapping your nose gesture/ Need to know gesture**

Point up towards the sky with your right index finger and then touch the right side of your nose so that almost all of your index finger is touching it, from the top to the bottom of your nose. Tap the side of your nose around three times. This means that I’m not going to tell you something. The reason for touching the nose for this meaning is presumably the use of the word “nose” in the expressions “Don’t be nosy” and “Don’t poke your nose into other people’s business”

**Touching wood gesture/ Knocking on wood gesture**

Hold your hand in a fist, but perhaps with the middle knuckle a little further out than the other fingers. Knock your knuckle(s) on something wooden such as a table two or three times. This is done for good luck, or more specifically for taking away the bad luck that you might have attracted by suggesting that something great that could happen, as in “I really think that I will pass the exam this time, touch wood!” Note that it must be wood that you knock on, not metal etc. However, some people do knock themselves on their forehead as a kind of joke. Perhaps because most people don’t actually believe the superstition behind this gesture, it is also possible to say “… touch wood!” with this meaning without necessarily actually doing the action.

**Neck cutting/ Slitting your neck gestures**

There are two neck cutting gestures with very different meanings. The softer and more common one is done with your whole hand. Hold your right hand at the level of your neck with all of the fingers pointing towards it and your palm down. Twist your wrist clockwise and anticlockwise about three times, without changing the position of your arm. Your hand should make a cutting motion as it twists in front of your neck. This gesture means “Stop speaking” and/ or “Time’s up”. It is most often used by someone at the back of the presentation room to tell the presenter that they have to bring their presentation to a close. It can also be used with the meaning of “Don’t say that”, e.g. to tell someone else in your negotiating team not to give away that info to the other side.

The other neck cutting gesture consists of your right index finger being drawn slowly from the left of your neck to the right side while touching the skin, making it really look like the horror movie version of cutting someone’s neck. Unsurprisingly, this gesture means “I will kill you (later)”, although it is usually used at least half jokingly. For example, I used to make this gesture towards my sisters at the dinner table when they told my parents things like “Today, I saw Alex throwing stones at…”to mean “I’ll get you later”.

**Air quotes gesture**

Make peace signs on both sides of your head with the middle fingers and index fingers of both hands in V shapes. Make sure that you have your palms facing towards the other person so you are not making rude V signs. Bend all four fingers down towards your palm and then point them almost straight up again about four times, finishing with curved fingers. This gesture is supposed to make the shape of quotation marks (“”). The meaning is the same as the ironic use of quotation marks in English writing, in phrases like “As everyone knows, he’s a ‘genius’”, meaning he’s not a genius at all and/ or only he thinks he is a genius. So if you say “It’s interesting” with no gesture is could really genuinely mean interesting, but if you make the air quotes gesture during the word “interesting” it would mean something like “It’s weird”.

**Cross your heart gesture**

With your right index finger, draw a vertical and then a horizontal line over the left side of your chest, as if you are drawing a (Christian) cross over your heart. This like a Catholic or Orthodox believer making a cross over their heart for religious reasons, but isn’t used that way in the Protestant churches that are most common in the UK. Instead, it just means “I promise (that I will do it/ that what I said is true)”, sometimes with the accompanying words “Cross my heart” or perhaps even the longer version “Cross my heart, hope to die, stick a needle in my eye”.

**I/ Me gesture**

There are several ways of indicating yourself in English, which all entail pointing to your chest in different ways. The best two are pointing at your chest with the index finger or all four fingers of one hand. Holding your heart with one hand usually means “I’m touched (by your kind gesture” and so can seem too emotional just for “I/ me/ my”. Pointing at your chest with your thumb is too macho for most situations

**Shaking your head gestures**

The most common way of saying “No” in English is to twist your neck so that your head turns from side to side. This is usually done about three times fairly slowly, but if it is done really slowly while looking down it has the stronger meaning of “I can’t believe you said that/ did that”, similar to a face palm.

**Calm down gesture**

Put out both hands palms down at about hip height, about 25 centimetres in front of you. Move the hands slowly up and down about five or ten centimetres. This means “calm down”, as in “don’t get angry”, and also “slow down” or “Please keep the volume down”. Although it can depend on how you do it, the calm down gesture is usually more polite than a finger in front of your lips if you want to ask someone to be quiet.
