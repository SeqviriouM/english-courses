## Homework

### News 1. Renting luxury cars.

Mr Hashi (25 y.o.), from Newport, hired the luxury supercar Lamborghini from Saeed Ali Rent a Car on 7 August while visiting friends in Dubai. In four hours he triggered every speed camera on the Sheikh Zayed Road by driving at up to 150mph (240km/h). His fines totalled 175,000 dirhams, or £36,000 ($46,000).

The dealership where Mr Hashi rented the Lamborghini Huracán told the city's newspaper, The National, he left his passport as a guarantee. The firm said it would not give him his documents until he paid the fines. But due to its laws the firm can't hold his documents. So after receiving all fines he can leave the country. But the company could not get the Lamborghini back from officials in Dubai until Mr Hashi paid the fine.

He added his brother had not known about Dubai's speeding laws and had been forced to borrow money from a friend to pay for his extended stay. If you don't know laws doesn't mean that you can not follow them.

The most amazing in this story, that Mr Hashi's family are planning to launch legal proceedings against the firm when he returns home. (because his brother said the firm seized his brother's passport after he had driven the car).

### News 2. New tech lets submarines 'email' planes.

At present, it is difficult for planes to pick up underwater sonar signals because they reflect off the water's surface and rarely break through.

Submarines communicate using sonar waves, which travel well underwater but struggle to break through the surface. Planes communicate using radio signals that do not travel well in water.

The researchers found an extremely high-frequency radar could detect tiny ripples in water, created by an ordinary underwater speaker.
This could let lost flight recorders and submarines communicate with planes.

The system developed at MIT uses an underwater speaker to aim sonar signals directly at the water's surface, creating tiny ripples only a few micrometres in height.

These ripples can be detected by high-frequency radar above the water and decoded back into messages.

The researchers tested the idea in a swimming pool and were able to successfully receive the underwater messages from above the surface.
However, the system can take a long time to send a large amount of data - and it does not work when there are waves taller than 16cm (6in) in the water.

### Whatever it takes

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous [vʌl tʃər əs]
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up

I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline [əˈdrenəlɪn] in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom [ˈmɑːtədəm] 
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal [ˈprɔdɪgəl] son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up

I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost

I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased

And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
